Data analysis scripts for the master's thesis of Sampo Vesanen

## Records and visitors analysis apps on shinyapps.io
You may view and explore my research data with these two Shiny apps deployed on shinyapps.io. These are the same tools as I used to analyse the results of my thesis. Please note that these apps are pretty wonky on mobile because of limited screen space. Access on desktop for full functionality.
