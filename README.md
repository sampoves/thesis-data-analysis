# Msc_thesis_data_analysis
Data analysis for Master's thesis of Sampo Vesanen

Python code tested with Anaconda Personal Distribution 2020.02 (Python 3.7.6, Pandas 1.0.1) and GeoPandas 0.5.0. R code tested with R for Windows 3.6.3.

Code not tested on R 4.0.0. However, explicit ``stringsAsFactors = TRUE`` has been added to all ``read.csv()`` and ``readOGR()`` calls.

## Records and visitors analysis apps on Shinyapps.io
You may view and explore my research data with these two ShinyApps deployed on Shinyapps.io. These are the same tools as I used to analyse the results of my thesis. Please note that these apps are pretty wonky on mobile because of limited screen space. Access on desktop for full functionality.
